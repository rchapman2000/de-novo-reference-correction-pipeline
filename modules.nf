    /*
    The script first computes sites to mask by identifying sites that have less than
    the minimum coverage provided. However, there are formatting issues with the pileup
    format that make this difficult. Samtools mpileup's output has the depth in 0-based
    format, which makes it impossible to distinguish between a site with 0 and 1 coverage.

    Thus, the pipeline instead makes use of bedtools subtract. It first creates a pileup for only sites with
    coverage, uses an in-house script to filter sites with less than the minimum coverage
    and converts these into a bed file.

    Next, the pipeline creates a pileup containing every site, and converts this into a bed file using
    the in-house script. 

    Finally, the sites we want to keep (those above the minimum coverage threshold) are substracted
    from the bed file with every site, to give us the low-coverage sites.

    Additionally, there is an interesting case when the sites that fall within a deletion are marked as masked.
    Because masking is applied first, this will cause an error when applying the variants (as the deletion site will contain 
    an N character and will not match the VCF reference). Thus, the pipeline uses bcftools to create a bed file for all indel sites,
    and then subtracts these from the low coverage sites. Now, this results in the sites to mask.

    The bedtools maskfasta command is then used to mask the reference at these positions.

    Then the variants are applied to the mask fasta. The reason this is done after masking is 
    because the pileup (and therefore masking) positions do not account for indels, which would
    shift the genomic coordinates (we would end up masking things we did not want to).

    The fasta is then wrapped using bioawk to make the sequence one line.

    Finally, the coverage is calculated by grabbing the sequence length using bioawk,
    and subtracting the masked positions divided by the length from 1 using awk.

    The number of masked sites and coverage are then added to the summary string.
